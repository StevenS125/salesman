      My name is Steve Snyder and I’m your Mercedes-Benz Connection, 
      in Charlotte, NC and the surrounding area. 
      I have been in the business since 2011 and 
      am passionate about helping people find the perfect vehicle 
      at this fantastic Mercedes-Benz dealership in the 
      Charlotte area. I specialize in making the car business not suck. 
      My tag line “Buying a Car Doesn’t have to Suck”™ is proven time and time again. 
      Whether you’re buying your first car, or are a seasoned buyer, 
      you will know from the start that I am here to help. 
      As several of my customers have pointed out in their reviews on Google 
      and Dealer Rater I do not pressure you into buying a car or attempt to 
      put you in a vehicle you don’t want. I will be more than happy to 
      honestly, and correctly, answer any questions you may have. 
      You can check out my blog for more information on our inventory, 
      product reviews and events or contact me directly to 
      learn more about Charlotte Mercedes-Benz.
